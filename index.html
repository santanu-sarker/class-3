<h3>History</h3>
<p>
In 1980, physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee,</a> a contractor at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> 
proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.<br>
 In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.<br>
 That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. <br>
 In his personal notes from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
